# Vane

## Theme
Theme files are generated from `design/seed` by `design/generate-theme.mjs` (`cd design && npm run generate`). Never edit them by hand; to change the theme, change the seed.
Generated: `app/src/main/java/com/theseuntaylor/vane/core/theme/Color.kt`, `app/src/main/res/font/*.ttf`, `app/src/main/assets/font-licenses/`.

## Testing
E2E check for the home screen widget (app closed + offline): `scripts/e2e/widget_offline.sh [emulator-serial]` after `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Artifacts land in `build/e2e/`.
